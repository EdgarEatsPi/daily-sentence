# A program that helps you build your vocabulary.
The purpose of this program is to expand your vocabulary while also trying to make it fun.
This is mainly aimed at me, Edgar, but if you find it useful I'd recommend making it boot up every time you turn on your computer.
(Whether that'd be on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)

## To do:
- ~~Write initial program to ask for three sentences.~~
- Add points for every sentence written with the word + keep track of such in monthly file alongside words and sentences.
- Add monthly review feature where it goes over your achievements throughout the month at the end of it.
- Add extra points for using the previous day's word.
- Add streak feature + keep track of such in all-time file.
- Add yearly review + save in all-time file.
